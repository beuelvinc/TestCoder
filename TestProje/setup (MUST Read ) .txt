To run this code, you have install requirements.txt by running pip install -r requirements.txt (better to run in virtual env)

I have used this project with Postgresql but to avoid anycomplications I send sqlite version to you.

You should run python manage.py runserver

and start checking

admin credentials

username:admin 
password:admin

you can also create first user by running (python manage.py createsuperuser)

data manager credentials:

username: elvinriga
password: elvin123





If you want to create your own database, then you should use 

python manage.py makemigrations

python manage.py migrate

python manage.py createsuperuser

keep in mind first user must be created by using (python manage.py createsuperuser)
